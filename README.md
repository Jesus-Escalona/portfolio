# My Portfolio

Static page with lots of css.

[Demo Website](https://jcode.dev)

- TailwindCSS & styled-components
- React Spring
- Playful & Colorful One-Page website with Parallax effect

Thanks to [@bradlc](https://github.com/bradlc)â€™s work on [babel-plugin-tailwind-components](https://github.com/bradlc/babel-plugin-tailwind-components), we can easily get the power of Tailwind without the stylesheet bloat by passing Tailwind classes into styled-components with **Babel macros** ðŸŽ‰.

## Why?

If you want to quickly bootstrap a design/photography portfolio or use it as a foundation for your personal site, the starters in _gatsby-starter-portfolio_ are a perfect fit for you! The project's goal is to offer minimalistic and fast websites.

Check out the [Gatsby Starter Portfolio Overview](https://gatsby-starter-portfolio.netlify.com/)!

## Features

- [React Spring](https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring) (Used for Parallax effect)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styling
  - Use the full power of TailwindCSS while generating small styles (as unused data gets deleted)
  - Uses `tailwind.macro` (Babel macro) to have hot-reloading of Tailwind styles
- SEO
  - Schema.org JSONLD
  - OpenGraph Tags
  - Twitter Tags
- [Typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces) for quicker font loading
- Offline Support
- WebApp Manifest Support
- Responsive images
  - The right image size for every screen size
  - Traced SVG Loading (Lazy-Loading)
  - WebP Support

**Please note:** The parallax effect can be quite heavy for some older CPUs and the site uses some newer CSS features which will result in incompatibility with older browsers.

## Getting Started

Check your development environment! You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) installed. The official Gatsby website also lists two articles regarding this topic:

- [Gatsby on Windows](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-on-windows/)
- [Check your development environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/)

To copy and install this starter run this command (with "project-name" being the name of your folder you wish to install it in):

```
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara
cd project-name
npm run dev
```

### Adding new features/plugins

You can add other features by having a look at the official [plugins page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/).

### Building your site

```
npm run build
```

Copy the content of the `public` folder to your webhost or use a website like Netlify which automates that for you.


### Typography

Instead of relying on Google's CDN to host its fonts, this site self-hosts the fonts and therefore benefits from increased performance. The installed fonts can be found in `src/components/Layout.jsx`:

```JSX
import 'typeface-cantata-one';
import 'typeface-open-sans';
```

This starter uses [typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces) by Kyle Mathews. Have a look at the repository if you want to install & use other fonts.

You'll also need to configure `fonts` in `tailwind.js` to reflect the changes. You then can use the fonts with `font-sans` and `font-serif`.
